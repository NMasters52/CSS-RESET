# CSS Reset

A simple, modern CSS reset to ensure consistent styling across all browsers. This reset sets a strong foundation for your web projects by normalizing default browser styles and improving cross-browser compatibility.

## Features

- **Box-Sizing**: Ensures consistent `box-sizing` across all elements, including `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements.
- **Zero Margins**: Resets margins to `0` across all elements to prevent inconsistent default spacing.
- **Body Styles**: Sets a smooth `line-height` and improves font rendering for better readability.
- **Media Elements**: Images, videos, and other media elements are set to be responsive by default (`max-width: 100%`).
- **Form Elements**: Inputs, buttons, textareas, and selects inherit typography styles for a consistent look.
- **Typography**: Headings, paragraphs, and list items are styled to improve text wrapping and readability.
- **Container Isolation**: Adds isolation for root containers to improve composability with other components, preventing CSS leaks.
